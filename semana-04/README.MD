is a project in html in which various types of elements are used
Within this project there are images, ordered lists, disorganized, shortcuts to social networks and a table to complete with data such as: name, email, telephone number, select a sector and leave a message


week-04


this week we incorporated flexbox and made it responsive, we also incorporated @media queris.

There were still details to solve, such as the hamburgersa button and the background of the homepage that I did not manage to incorporate, in addition to making the correct routing of the github page.


and for leaving the readme for the last moment I couldn't add details to make it look better.
